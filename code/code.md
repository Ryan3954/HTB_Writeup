# üß¨ HTB Machine: Code

### üåê Machine Information
- **IP:**  10.10.11.58
- **OS:** Linux
### üß≠ Information Gathering
- I started with an Nmap scan to identify open ports and running services: `nmap -A -p- 10.10.11.62 -oN nmap_scan`
![Screenshot](https://imgur.com/XqXmywU.png)
- Nmap Results 2 open ports: 22 (ssh), 5000 (HTTP Python-based web service)
- Visiting port 5000 in a browser revealed a web-based Python code editor. However, it included multiple restrictions

- Common functions and modules like `eval, exec, open, read, import, os, and __builtins__` were blocked.
- This indicated a Python sandbox or "Python Jail."

### üß® Escaping the Python Jail
- After researching common Python Jail bypass techniques, Here's the payload I used to run the whoami command

- This returns the current user.

### üìÇ Exploring the Filesystem
- Using similar payloads, I navigated the filesystem and confirmed the working directory:

- After exploring the `app-production` directory, I found the user flag at `/home/app-production/user.txt`
- So i used this payload to retrieve the user flag

- While exploring the `app-production` directory earlier, I found another interesting file named `database.db` inside `instance` directory.
- So I downloaded the file to my local machine with this payload:

- Before running the payload on the website, I need to use the command: `nc -lvnp 5555 > code_database.db`
- After getting the file, I opened `code_database.db` with `sqlite3`

- Inside the database, I found credentials for a user named martin. The password was hashed, so I used hashes.com to crack it.

### üîê Gaining SSH Access
- With the recovered credentials, I logged into the machine via SSH: `ssh martin@10.10.11.62`
![Screenshot](https://imgur.com/tTyG86X.png)
- Successfully logged in as martin.

### üîº Privilege Escalation
- I checked martin‚Äôs sudo permissions: `sudo -l`
![Screenshot](https://imgur.com/OunL0c5.png)
- Output showed martin can run `backy.sh` as root without a password.
- `backy.sh` appears to read from a JSON file and archives a specified directory provided by the JSON file.

### üì¶ Abusing `backy.sh`
- The script only allows archiving directories under /var/ or /home/.
- Attempting to archive /root directly failed. So, I tried using traversal bypass.

- But it doesn't works

- Targeted Directory became /home/martin/root, because the script sanitize `../` by replacing it with `""`
![Screenshot](https://imgur.com/d1IC0Jz.png)
- So I used another payload:

- It Works!
- After archiving the `root` directory, I sent it to my local machine
- With that, I opened the archive and extract the `root flag`
