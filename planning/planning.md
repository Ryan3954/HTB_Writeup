### üßæ Machine Information
- **IP:** 10.10.11.68  
- **OS:** Linux  
- **Credential:** `admin:0D5oT70Fq13EvB5r`

### üîç Information Gathering
- I started with an Nmap scan using the following command: `nmap -A -oN nmap_scan 10.10.11.68`
- This Revealed 2 ports:

- 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP)
- Navigating to `http://10.10.11.68` showed a website that didn‚Äôt resolve properly at first. I added the hostname to `/etc/hosts`
- Now planning.htb loads in the browser.

### üìÅ Directory & Subdomain Enumeration
- Initially, browsing the site manually didn‚Äôt reveal much, so I used DirBuster to enumerate hidden directories. This yielded several directories and files, but nothing obviously vulnerable.

- I then tried Wfuzz to enumerate subdomains using the `services-names` wordlist and discovered one: `grafana.planning.htb`

- I added it to `/etc/hosts` as well

### üîê Accessing Grafana

- I successfully logged in. In the settings, it shows that the Grafana version is 11.0.0.

### üõ†Ô∏è Exploiting Grafana (CVE-2024-9264)
- I searched online for any known vulnerabilities for Grafana v11.0.0 and came across: `CVE-2024-9264` a known RCE vulnerability.
- I used the following PoC from GitHub: https://github.com/z3k0sec/CVE-2024-9264-RCE-Exploit
- Running the `PoC` while running `nc` gave me remote shell access.

### üê≥ Detecting Containerization
- While inspecting the environment, I noticed: Presence of the `.dockerenv` file at `/`

- This suggested I was inside a Docker container.
- I uploaded LinPEAS using wget to enumerate possible escape path

### üßæ Finding SSH Credentials
- LinPEAS revealed environment variables with credentials: `enzo : RioTecRANDEntANT!`
![Screenshot](https://imgur.com/1W7uvnm.png)
- I used these credentials to try logging in via SSH: `ssh enzo@10.10.11.68`
![Screenshot](https://imgur.com/DVj1Y6R.png)
- With this access, I can search for the user flag.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Privilege Escalation
- To escalate privileges, I uploaded and ran `linpeas.sh` again, this time on the host system.

- It revealed an interesting file: `/tmp/bash` (owned by `root`)
- I ran it with: `/tmp/bash -p`

- And got a root shell. From there, I was able to access the root flag and submit it.
